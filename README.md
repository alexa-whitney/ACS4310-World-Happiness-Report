## Description

Using D3.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating data visualizations, I've created a bar chart that shows the happiness scores of the top 10 happiest countries. Each bar represents a country, and the height of the bar corresponds to the happiness score. Each bar is color-coded uniquely for easy distinction between countries.

## Data

The data for this project comes from the 2019 World Happiness Report, which ranks countries by their happiness levels. The top 10 countries were selected for this visualization. The data includes the following fields:

- Country
- Score (happiness score, which forms the basis for the rankings)

## Setup

To view this visualization, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that the `2019.csv` data file is located in the same directory as the `index.html` file.

## Features

- Unique color coding for each country
- Axis labels for clarity
